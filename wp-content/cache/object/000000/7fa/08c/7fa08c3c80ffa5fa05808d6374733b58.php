With one of the longest coastlines of any African country, untouched and spectacularly beautiful, Mozambique is the gem of any Africa Gap Year. Plenty of adrenaline sports and cool chill out experiences await you in Tofo, with the Xtreme Gap Year Mozambique Adventure programme cramming in the best that the country has to offer. Did you know there is amazing surf breaks here? Interspersed with a massive whale shark population itâ€™s a great backpacker location and a superb place to chill out for a week or two. The longer you stay the more you get to do.

A modular trip booked by the week, the trip gives you the opportunity to do some seriously fun activities.

This trip is especially good when booked in connection with the Kruger to Coast sports programme as you can end up bolting assaults the trip to prolong your African Xtreme Gap experience.
