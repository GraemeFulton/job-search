Finally a plugin to fully customize the BuddyPress profile menu. This plugin enables you to append regular Wordpress custom menus to BuddyPress.

== Description ==

= **NEW!** Plugin now fully supports BuddyPress 1.7 and the new template compatibility features! This means that your custom tabs will now display beautifully in any theme, even if the theme doesn't natively support BuddyPress. =

The BuddyPress Custom Profile Menu plugin customizes the standard BuddyPress profile menu tabs in three easy steps:

1. Create a regular Wordpress menu containing all the pages you want to append to the BuddyPress profile menu.
2. Select the created menu in the plugin's settings page.
3. Voila! A new profile menu tab and admin bar menu item will be automatically created for each page in the custom menu. When a tab is clicked, it automatically fetches its contents from its corresponding page contents. It's that simple!

= Want more control? =

If you like this plugin but would like to visually reorder the tabs, or get more features such as sub-tabs, public tabs, or iframe tabs, make sure to grab yourself a copy of the <strong>Pro</strong> version from <a href="http://sensibleplugins.com" target="_blank"><strong>Sensible Plugins</strong></a>.
