Adds a resume page to BuddyPress profile. Also adds nav menu item under Avatar and in admin bar. 



== Description ==


Need to add an online resume to BuddyPress? We developed a pluging that is small and compact just for you. It gives the member the ability to add "Education", "Professional Experience", and "Skills" to their profile. It sorts the users entries by date, newest first, and allows them to delete unwanted entries. Simple to use, and follows the BuddyPress theme. 

There is no backend settings to configure, it's all frontend, just that simple.
