Requires at least: 3.2.1
Tested up to: 3.3.1
BuddyPress: 1.5.1
Stable tag: 1.2

== Description ==

Let your members and groups show their Twitter Follow Button on their profile page and group page. Using the twitter's @username widget, the plugin fetches your members and/or groups username and displays their folow button in the member's/group's header.

If your BuddyPress community is active on Twitter, this plugin is a great tool for boosting communication both on and off your website.

It's really easy to setup, even if you have an existing community:

Members: Once you ( the site admin ) have set up the members component, all your members have to do is enter in their Twitter username upon registration and existing members via editing their profile settings.

Groups: Once you ( the site admin ) have set up the groups component, all your group admins have to do is enter in their associated Twitter username when they create a group and existing groups via editing their group's details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the 'Group Field Title' for? =

The group field title is the title that will be displayed right above the text box where the group will enter in their Twitter Username.

= Will the 'Mirror Profile Field Title' also be displayed above the text box where the member will enter in their Twitter Username.? =

No, the text box will use the title you gave your Xprofile field as described in step 6 of the plugin installation instructions. The 'Mirror Profile Field Title' is used to fetch the members meta ( attached data ) though if the two differ, no data will be returned thus no button will display.

= Where can I get support or request a feature? =

I will only respond to the [Buddypress Twitter Forum](http://buddypress.org/community/groups/buddypress-twitter/forum/ “Buddypress Twitter Support”) or on my Blog ( I am working on my blog so its abit of a mess, best you use the Forum )
