Adds a configurable search form to your BuddyPress site, so visitors can find site members searching their extended profiles.

== Description ==

BP Profile Search adds a configurable search form to your BuddyPress site, so visitors can find site members searching their extended profiles.

You can insert the search form in the Members Directory page, in a sidebar or widget area, or in any post or page.

In all three cases when visitors click the 'Search' button, they are redirected to your Members Directory page showing their search results. The 'All Members' tab shows all the results, while the 'My Friends' tabs shows the results found among your visitor's friends.

== Installation ==

After the standard manual or automatic plugin installation procedure, you'll be able to access the plugin settings page *Users -> Profile Search*.

= Configuration =

In the plugin settings page you have the following options:

* Specify the HTML text for the form header and welcome message.

* Enable the toggle form feature.

* Select the profile fields to include in the search form (currently the *datebox* profile fields are not supported);

* If your extended profiles include a numeric field, enable the Value Range search, so your visitors can specify the minimum and maximum value for their search.

* If your extended profiles include a birth date field, enable the Age Range search, so your visitors can specify the minimum and maximum age for their search.

* Insert the search form in the Members Directory page.

* Select the search mode for text fields, between *partial match*, where a search for *John* matches field values of *John*, *Johnson*, *Long John Silver*, and so on, and *exact match*, where a search for *John* matches the field value *John* only.

In both search modes the wildcard characters *% (percent sign)*, matching zero or more characters, and *_ (underscore)*, matching exactly one character, are available to your visitors to better specify their search.

= Displaying the search form =

There are three different ways to integrate your BP Profile Search form in your BuddyPress site. You can insert the form:

* In your Members Directory page, using the above mentioned option

* In a sidebar or widget area, using the ***BP Profile Search*** widget

* In a post or page, using the shortcode **[bp_profile_search_form]**
