This lightweight WordPress plugin provides a widget and shortcode to display related posts as thumbnails, links, excerpts or as full posts. 

== Description ==

Display related posts as thumbnails, links, excerpts or as full posts with a widget or shortcode. Posts with the **most terms in common** will display at the top. Use multiple taxonomies and post types to get the related posts. Include or exclude terms. Change the look and feel with your own html templates in your (child) theme.  

Plugin features:

* Widget and shortcode.
* Display post thumbnails, links, excerpts or full posts.
* Exclude or include terms.
* Exclude posts.
* Limit related posts by date.
* Display related posts on single post pages only.
* Automatically display related posts after the post content.
* Use your own templates for display of the related posts.
* Use plugin functions to get related posts in your theme templates.
* Filters to change the default behavior and display of the plugin.

For more information about the plugin see the [documentation](http://keesiemeijer.wordpress.com/related-posts-by-taxonomy/).

To have the related posts automatically display after the post content without using the shortcode or widget see the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/related-posts-by-taxonomy/faq/). 

Default usage for the shortcode is:
<pre><code>[related_posts_by_tax]</code></pre>

Attributes for the shortcode are:

* post_id
* taxonomies
* post_types
* posts_per_page
* order
* orderby
* title
* before_title
* after_title
* exclude_terms
* include_terms
* exclude_posts
* format
* image_size
* columns
* caption
* limit_posts
* limit_year
* limit_month

Example to show 10 related posts instead of the default 5.
<pre><code>[related_posts_by_tax posts_per_page="10"]</code></pre>

See the [documentation](http://keesiemeijer.wordpress.com/related-posts-by-taxonomy/) for more information about the attributes and their defaults.
