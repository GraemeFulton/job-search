Background Per Page allows you to set a custom background per page (or post) as well as set up a default background for all other pages/posts.

== Description ==

Easily add background options on a per page/post basis. 

Currently the plugin includes the following features-

* Add a background image
* Options for vertical & horizontal repeating
* Fade out the bottom edge of your background image
* Choose background colour
* Child pages of a page with a custom background will inherit the parent page background settings.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `background-per-page` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory keeping the file structure.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Edit or add a new post or page and you will see a new meta box to add your background options
4. To set your default background settings go to `Appearance -> Background`.
