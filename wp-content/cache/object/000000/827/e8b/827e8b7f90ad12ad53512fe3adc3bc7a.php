Addiction and its related harms can be crippling for those affected and the people around them.          But how does addiction develop? What can we do to treat it? What can we do to prevent it?         In this course we explore how addiction develops, and look at the risks environmentally, genetically and personally for developing addiction.</p>                  <p>We examine what happens when a drug enters your body and your brain and how your brain changes – how this process, can make recovering from addiction such a challenge. Our team will describe how we can best treat addiction and how national and international policies help limit the harms from addiction.</p>                  <p>King’s College London Institute of Psychiatry is a world leader in the science and treatment of addiction.         Lecturers in this course are drawn from a variety of disciplines throughout King’s College London – who work together to understand and respond to addiction.</p>                  <p>Each week, our teaching is supplemented by some of the world’s leading scientists who will present cutting edge neuroscientific research. Research that will lead to a greater understanding of how addiction develops and how we can treat it most effectively.</p>                  <p>By understanding addiction, we can shed light on the greater issues of self-control and choice. Indeed, we are developing a greater understanding of ourselves.</p>                  <p>By the end of this course, students should be able to: </p>                  <ol>         <li>             <p>Explain the psychopharmacological, neurobiological and psychosocial basis of addiction </p>           </li>           <li>             <p>Exemplify King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry’s world-leading research into multidisciplinary approaches and clinical practice approaches to addiction </p>           </li>           <li>             <p>Describe in detail the human and clinical manifestation of addiction, incorporating an exploration of addiction-related harm and user perspectives. </p>           </li>         </ol>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: King&#39;s College London | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: Kyle Dyer </p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:33:"Understanding Drugs and Addiction";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:130:"How do addictions develop?
