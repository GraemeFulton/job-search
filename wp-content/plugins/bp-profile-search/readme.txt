Lets visitors search your BuddyPress Members Directory and their Friends list.

== Description ==

BP Profile Search adds a configurable search form to your BuddyPress site, to let visitors search your Members Directory and their Friends list.

You can insert the search form in your Members Directory page, in a sidebar or widget area, or in any post or page.

When visitors click the *Search* button, they are redirected to your Members Directory page showing their search results. The *All Members* tab shows all the results, while the *My Friends* tab shows the results found among your visitor's friends.

== Installation ==

After the standard plugin installation procedure, you'll be able to access the plugin settings page *Users -> Profile Search*, where you can build and customize your search form.

= Form Fields =

In this section you can:

* Add and remove form fields
* Enter the field label and description, or leave them empty to use the default
* Enable the *Value Range Search* for numeric fields, or the *Age Range Search* for date fields
* Change the order of the fields

= Add to Directory =

With this option you can insert your search form in your Members Directory page. If you enable *Add to Directory*, you can also:

* Enter the HTML text for the optional form header
* Enable the *Toggle Form* option
* Enter the text for the *Toggle Form* button

= Text Search Mode =

With this option you can select your text search mode, between:

* *Partial Match*: a search for *John* finds *John*, *Johnson*, *Long John Silver*, and so on
* *Exact Match*: a search for *John* finds *John* only

In both modes, two wildcard characters are available:

* *% (percent sign)*: matches any text, or no text at all
* *_ (underscore)*: matches any single character

= Display your search form =

After you build your search form, you can display it:

* In your Members Directory page, selecting the option *Add to Directory*
* In a sidebar or widget area, using the widget *Profile Search*
* In a post or page, using the shortcode **[bp_profile_search_form]**
* Anywhere in your theme, using the PHP code<br>
**&lt;?php do_action ('bp_profile_search_form'); ?&gt;**
