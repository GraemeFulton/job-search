As the course progresses, the structure and function of important organs will be demonstrated, discussed and related to common surgical scenarios and current research. Each of the 3 weeks will focus on a specific area of the abdomen; starting at the surface you will then enter the abdomen and be able to detail the anatomy of numerous organs including the stomach and liver.</p>                  <p>At the end of each week subject specialists such as surgeons, pathologists and radiologists will come together to compare and discuss contrasting surgical techniques. This will help you to apply your understanding of basic anatomy to common clinical scenarios and research being undertaken at the University of Leeds.</p>                  <p>For example, in the first week of the course you will examine the complex anatomy of the abdominal wall and discover why this area is of particular interest to surgeons during inguinal hernia repair.</p>                  <p>In this course your tutor James Pickering will take you on a journey to explore the depths of the human abdomen.</p>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: University of Leeds | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: James Pickering (Educator)</p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:36:"Exploring anatomy: the human abdomen";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:80:"Explore the anatomy of the human abdomen and appreciate its clinical importance.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:46:"exploring-anatomy-the-human-abdomen-2014-02-12";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:25";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:25";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"course";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
