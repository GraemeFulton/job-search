Bali is a popular backpacker location and there are definitely two sides to the island. The hectic, somewhat spoiled touristy parts, and the more authentic laid-back locations. This programme set in two unforgettable locations, Ubud the cultural heart of Bali, where you spend the first three weeks and the more laid-back Canggu near the famous surf spot Echo Beach, is the favourite destination for those who want culture, stunning sunset view, great beach side restaurants and cafes, surfing, great atmosphere and vibes. This idyllic area is the best spot for you to chill out far away from hustling and bustling city of Kuta. However, in Canggu you will not only be able to immerse in tranquility but also enjoy plenty of fun activities while feeling like you have experienced the real Bali.";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"The Xtreme Bali Experience";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:4:"5740";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-12-22 11:44:25";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-12-22 11:44:25";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:65:"http://localhost/LGWP/?post_type=travel-opportunities&#038;p=5740";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:20:"travel-opportunities";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
