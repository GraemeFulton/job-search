When was the last time you took an adventure? Now you can experience one of the last great adventures, the Inca Trail. Discover the The Lost City of ¬†the Incas, Machu Picchu, which is undoubtedly the most recognised symbol of Inca civilization. Perched high up in the Andes, it is known to be the only Inca city that was never found by the Spanish.
<div>‚ÄúThe Inca Trail‚Äù, as it is commonly called, was originally the Camino Real, or Royal Highway, that led pilgrims and officials of the Empire to the Sacred City of the Incas. Winding through several mountain passes high up in the Andes, the trail leads through several lookout points, from where the Incas could see any approaching enemies.&nbsp;

What makes the Inca Trail so intriguing is the amazing combination of Inca ruins, superb views, the dramatic Andes scenery. There is plenty of flora ( 250 species of orchid have been counted in the Machu Picchu Historic Sanctuary) as well as fauna -¬† numerous birds such as hummingbirds, waterfowl and the majestic Andean condor. Not to mention the odd alpaca lama!

Ask anyone travelling to Peru, and they will all state they are heading to the Inca Trail, taking four days to complete, it is as much about the adventure as it is about meeting fellow trekkers!

Starting on the same day you will bump into the same people en route, and although the pace may well be different for everyone, climbing at altitude is not easy,everyone camps out at the same spots, making the night times a pretty social experience.

In the day you will push on through ever-changing scenery, passing sheer cliff drops, llamas, trekkers, ruins and many excited adventurers heading to Machu Picchu. All different nationalities get together around camp fires to discuss, well you name it, anything and everything. International life time friendships are cemented in just four days.

This is the very essence of what makes travelling so cool, and it all happens on the Inca Trail.
<h2>Two hour guided tour included</h2>
A guided tour of Machu Picchu with a professional English-speaking guide and then enjoy free time to explore the ruins, truly a once-in-a-lifetime unforgettable experience.
<h2>When And How</h2>
From March 2013 we have 5 departures per week:¬†¬†Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. With an included night in Cuzco the previous day.

Please be advised that there are limited numbers of trekking permits for each day (500) and once they are gone they are gone. Sometimes they sell out up to three months in advance so please book early. This means you have to set your date for arrival in Cuzco, but with our Lima to Cuzco travel pass you can get there easily enough. (You can also fly direct from Lima so be sure to check out the Lima surf connection arrival pack too. It rocks!)

<strong>Please note the Inca trail is closed in February for maintenance.</strong>

There are alternative routes you can take if you are unable to get a permit, however we advise you do not leave it to chance, this is a once in a life time adventure, and going to Peru and missing out on this trip is criminal!

If you want to know more about getting to Cuzco or any more detail on the trip, please request trip notes or contact us. Remember you can combine this trip with a more epic adventure across South America!";s:10:"post_title";s:19:"Trek The Inca Trail";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:19:"trek-the-inca-trail";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2013-12-22 16:17:57";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2013-12-22 16:17:57";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:65:"http://localhost/LGWP/?post_type=travel-opportunities&#038;p=5799";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:20:"travel-opportunities";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
