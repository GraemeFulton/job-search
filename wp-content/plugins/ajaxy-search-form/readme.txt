== Description ==

* the installation can be a little tricky though, "Best things doesn't always come the easy way", but i am ready to help out... please send me an email or leave me a message at ajaxy.org...

== Installation ==


1. Upload `ajaxy-search-form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3.(optional) if your theme uses a custom search form, then it should be disabled

To disable the theme search form, go to /wp-content/themes/YOUR_THEME_NAME/ and rename searchform.php to searchforma.php, this will keep the file but remove its reference

add a new function <?php echo ajaxy_search_form(); ?>, insert it into ur theme template

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

-After the plugin is activated, nothing appears
Make sure the theme search is disabled (test the ajaxy search form widget if it appears)

Each theme has its own styles, email me at icu090@gmail.com and i will fix it right away
