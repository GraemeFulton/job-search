In this course you will discover how organisms are linked together by complex interrelationships, how such links are studied and how the physical properties of a particular habitat interact with the organisms that inhabit it. Using case studies, you will come to learn how knowledge of ecosystems leads to understanding of their individual importance, and how they can be preserved.</p>                  <p>All Open University science courses presented on FutureLearn are produced with the kind support of Dangoor Education.</p>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: The Open University | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: David Robinson</p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:26:"Introduction to ecosystems";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:112:"Gain an understanding of the natural world, how the web of life works, with illustrations from around the world.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:37:"introduction-to-ecosystems-2014-02-12";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:48";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:48";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"course";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
