WordPress Website Security Protection. Website security protection against: XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking... 

== Description ==

= htaccess Core Website Security (Security/Firewalls) =

WordPress Website Security Protection: BulletProof Security protects your WordPress website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, 
Code Injection and SQL Injection... hacking attempts. One-click .htaccess WordPress security protection. Protects wp-config.php, 
bb-config.php, php.ini, php5.ini, install.php and readme.html with .htaccess security protection. Security Logging. HTTP Error Logging.
Login Security/Login Monitoring: Log All Account Logins or Log Only Account Lockouts. Website FrontEnd/BackEnd Maintenance Mode (HTTP 503). 
Additional website security checks: DB errors off, file and folder permissions check... System Info: PHP, MySQL, OS, Server, Memory 
Usage, IP, SAPI, DNS, Max Upload... Built-in .htaccess file Editor.

= Login Security & Monitoring Website Security (Security/Monitoring) =

Login Security & Login Monitoring: Log All User Account Logins or Log Only User Account Lockouts (see Screenshot). Brute Force Login Security Protection. 
Email alerting options allow you to choose 5 different email alerting options: Choose to have email alerts sent when a User Account is locked out, 
An Administrator Logs in, An Administrator Logs in and when a User Account is locked out, Any User logs in and when a User Account is locked out or 
Do Not Send Email Alerts. Choose Standard WP Error Messages or Generic Error Messages for Login Security Stealth Mode. Choose to Enable or Disable 
Login Password Reset capability for Login Security Stealth Mode. See BulletProof Security Login Security & Monitoring Features for additional features and options.

= BulletProof Security is Website Performance Optimized (Performance/Optimization) =

Website performance is just as important as website security. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized with website owners best interests at heart. 
* BulletProof Security does NOT abuse the WordPress Database by making excessive MySQL Queries.
* BulletProof Security does NOT store excessive & non-essential data in your WordPress Database.
* BulletProof Security does NOT use excessive Server Memory & Resources.
* BulletProof Security does NOT use gimmicks or bells & whistles that will cost website owners their website performance. 
* The benefits of having website security protection are negated if your website is performing poorly/slowly, continually experiencing out of memory 
errors/running out of memory, database size growing exponentially with non-essential stored data, etc. BulletProof Security can actually speed up & improve 
your website performance by using our Speed Boost Cache Bonus Code. See the BulletProof Security Bonus Custom Code help section below.

= FrontEnd/BackEnd Maintenance Mode (Security/Development) =

Display a website under maintenance page with Countdown Timer to website visitors while the website displays and functions normally for you. When the  
Countdown Timer has completed (reached 0) an email reminder is sent to you to remind you that the Countdown Timer has completed.
The new BPS Maintenance Mode design includes 20 background images, 15 center images (text box image), allows you to embed image files and YouTube videos, 
FrontEnd Maintenance Mode, BackEnd Maintenance Mode or both FrontEnd & BackEnd Maintenance Modes and most importantly is fast and simple to use so that you 
can switch in and out of Maintenance mode quickly and easily. FrontEnd Maintenance mode is primarily designed for development/maintenance purposes and 
BackEnd Maintenance Mode is technically a security feature since enabling BackEnd Maintenance Mode allows you to deny access to the /wp-admin folder/WP Dashboard 
by IP address. See BulletProof Security FrontEnd/BackEnd Maintenance Mode Features for additional features and options.

= Why is .htaccess Website Security So Much Better Than Any Other Type of Website Security? =

The answer is very simple - .htaccess files (distributed configuration files) are processed first before any other code on your website. In other words, 
hackers malicious scripts are stopped by BulletProof Security .htaccess files/Firewalls before those scripts even have a chance to 
reach the php code in WordPress. BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to 
Apache Linux Servers. Please read the FAQ page for Server compatibility questions.

= Security Log File Automation - Automatically Zipped, Emailed and Replaced =

Security Log files are automatically zipped, emailed and replaced with a new blank Security Log file when the log
file reaches the maximum file size setting that you choose. By Default BulletProof Security sets this DB option to
zip, email and replace the Security Log file when it reaches 500KB. The Security Log file is checked once per hour
with a WordPress Cron. The optimum recommended file size setting is 500KB.

= BulletProof Security Fast and Simple with No Manual Configuration Required =

The BulletProof Security WordPress Security plugin is designed to be a fast, simple and one click security plugin to 
add .htaccess website security protection for your WordPress website. Activate .htaccess website security and .htaccess 
website under maintenance modes from within your WordPress Dashboard - no FTP required. The BulletProof Security 
WordPress plugin is a one click security solution that creates, copies, renames, moves or writes to the provided 
BulletProof Security .htaccess master files. BulletProof Security protects both your Root website folder and wp-admin 
folder with .htaccess website security protection, as well as providing additional website security protection.

BulletProof Security allows you to add .htaccess website security protection from within the WordPress Dashboard so 
that you do not have to access your website via FTP or your Web Host Control Panel in order to add website security 
protection for your WordPress site. BulletProof Security Modes: Root .htaccess security protection, wp-admin .htaccess 
security protection, Deny All .htaccess self protection, WordPress default .htaccess mode and .htaccess Maintenance 
Mode (503 Website Under Maintenance). In BulletProof Security Mode your WordPress website is protected from XSS, RFI, 
CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts.

= BulletProof Security Additional Website Security Protection =

WordPress is already very secure, but every website, no matter what type of platform it is built on should
have additional website security measures in place as a standard. BulletProof Security provides that additional website
 security protection that every website should have.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess Core (Firewalls) work? =

The BulletProof Security Plugin allows you to instantly create and activate .htaccess website security with 
one click (ok maybe a few clicks) for your website without having to know anything about .htaccess files. The Master 
.htaccess files are pre-made and BPS writes .htaccess code that is customized for your website. There is nothing to figure out 
or to configure. Click the AutoMagic buttons (creates customized Master .htaccess files) and Activate BulletProof Modes (copies 
the customized Master .htaccess files to your root and wp-admin folders). BPS has built-in Backup and Restore and 
an .htaccess File Editor for full manual editing control as well. BulletProof Website Security fast and simple. Enjoy!

= How does BulletProof Security Plugin Login Security & Monitoring work? =

BulletProof Security Login Security & Monitoring allows you to choose whether you want to Log All User Account Logins or 
Log Only User Account Lockouts. The Dynamic DB Logging Form has 3 checkbox options: Lock, Unlock or Delete database rows. 
The Login Security database table is hooked into the WordPress Users database table, but they are 2 completely separate 
database tables. If you lock a User Account then BPS Pro will enforce that lock on that User Account and the User will not 
be able to log in. If you unlock a User Account then the User will be able to login. Deleting database rows in the Login Security 
database table does NOT delete the User Account from the WordPress Users database table. When you delete a User Account it is 
pretty much the same thing as unlocking a User Account. To delete actual User Accounts you would go to the WordPress Users page 
and delete that User Account.

= How does BulletProof Security FrontEnd/BackEnd Maintenance Mode work? =

FrontEnd Maintenance Mode creates template files based on the options you choose and save. When you Turn On Maintenance Mode those template files 
are copied to the root directory of your website. When you Turn Off Maintenance Mode those template files are deleted from the root directory 
of your website. Maintenance Mode works by allowing the IP addresses that you enter & save to view the site normally. All other IP addresses 
will see the Maintenance Mode template page. BackEnd Maintenance Mode writes directly to your wp-admin .htaccess file and adds a deny all block 
of .htaccess code with the IP addresses the you enter & save when you enable BackEnd Maintenance Mode. When you disable/uncheck BackEnd Maintenance 
Mode that deny all block of .htaccess code is removed/deleted from your wp-admin .htaccess file. For more extensive help info or CSS Code, Image & 
Video Embed examples to add in the Maintenance Mode Text, CSS Style Code, Images, Videos Displayed To Website Visitors text area click this 
Maintenance Mode Guide Forum Topic link: <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/maintenance-mode-guide-read-me-first/" title="Maintenance Mode Guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Maintenance Mode Guide</a>.

= What do I do if my User Account is locked out? =

You can either use FTP and rename the /bulletproof-security plugin folder to login to your site or a stand alone Login Security Unlock User Account 
Form has been created that allows you to Unlock locked User Accounts outside of your WordPress Dashboard. To use this stand alone script download 
it from this BulletProof Security Pro plugin folder - /wp-content/plugins/bulletproof-security/admin/htaccess/bpsunlock.php and then upload it to 
your website root folder. Then type in the path to the bpsunlock.php file in your Browser. Example: http://www.example.com/bpsunlock.php. The stand alone 
script displays step by step instructions on how to use it.

= Do I need to understand .htaccess code in order to use the BulletProof Security Plugin htaccess Core? =

No, The .htaccess file creation is automated in BulletProof Security. Everything is automatically done for you.
You do not need to know or understand anything about .htaccess website security files in order to use the 
BulletProof Security plugin. Extensive help information can be found in the Blue Read Me help buttons in BPS.

= What do I do if I cannot log back into my website due to an htaccess file problem? =

If you accidentally activated BulletProof Modes without first clicking the AutoMagic buttons and/or your IP address has been changed by your 
ISP and you cannot log back into your website then you will need to use FTP or your Web Host Control Panel File Manager and delete the .htaccess files 
that BPS creates in your website root folder and your wp-admin folder. BPS .htaccess website security is done purely with .htaccess website security files 
and nothing else is modified on your website. So simply deleting the .htaccess files in your website root folder & wp-admin folder removes BPS .htaccess 
website security and will allow you to log back in, use the AutoMagic buttons and activate BulletProof Modes again to protect your website again.

= Will BulletProof Security cause my website to run slower? =

No, BulletProof Security will not cause a website to run slower. BulletProof Security is website performance optimized 
and uses very little/low website resources and very little Server memory. If you would like to check your plugins to check 
how much website resource and Server memory each of your plugins is using install the P3 (Plugin Performance Profiler) plugin.
Both W3 Total Cache and WP Super Cache use .htaccess code to speed up your website.

= Can BulletProof Security speed up my website and make it run faster? =

Yes, BulletProof security can speed up your website and make it run faster if you use the Speed Boost Cache Bonus Code and 
add it to BPS Custom Code. See the BulletProof Security Bonus Custom Code section on the BulletProof Security plugin Description 
page for a link to the Speed Boost Cache Bonus Code.

= BPS Alert! Your site does not appear to be protected by BulletProof Security. What does the Alert mean? =

When upgrading/updating the BulletProof Security plugin you may see this WP Dashboard Alert. <strong>BPS Alert! Your site does not 
appear to be protected by BulletProof Security.</strong> There are 2 very common issues/problems that can cause this. The cPanel 
HotLink Protection Tool issue or the WordPress flush_rewrite_rules function issue. Click this link <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/bps-setup-steps-removal-steps-requirements-and-compatibility/" title="BulletProof Security Forum">Common BPS Issues</a> 
Note: Any custom htaccess code or modifications that you have made to your htaccess files will not be altered, modified or changed 
during the auto-update. Activating BulletProof Modes again after upgrading BPS is no longer necessary.

= Where can I find BulletProof Security additional troubleshooting steps & support? =

Please see the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/forum/bulletproof-security-free/" title="BulletProof Security Forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BulletProof Security Forum.</a>

= BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty =

* Compatible with Apache CGI configured Servers
* Compatible with Apache DSO configured Servers (May require CHOWN Ownership change or file/folder permission changes)
* <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/forums/topic/bulletproof-security-pro-compatibility-check-upgrading-from-bps-free-to-bps-pro/" title="DSO Help Info" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DSO Help Info</a>
* Compatible with Nginx frontend Server with Apache backend Server
* Compatible with LiteSpeed Servers
* Compatible with Windows IIS Servers - Windows Hosting - See IMPORTANT NOTES below.
* If your IIS Server has ISAPI_Rewrite installed then you CAN use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes.
* <strong>IMPORTANT NOTES:</strong> If you have an IIS Server you may or may not be able to use .htaccess files and can only use Login Security & Monitoring. 
If your IIS Server is using the URL Rewrite Module then you can probably use .htaccess files / BulletProof Modes. If you activate 
BulletProof Modes and your website crashes then FTP to your website and delete the root .htaccess file and the wp-admin .htaccess file. You 
will not be able to use .htaccess files on your Server/website and can only use Login Security and the other features in BPS.
 
= Additional BulletProof Security Server Compatibilty Info =

BulletProof Security uses .htaccess website security files, which are specific to Apache Linux Servers. BPS is compatible with Apache Linux Servers, 
LiteSpeed Servers, Nginx Servers (if the Nginx Server is the frontend Server and Apache Linux Server is the backend Server). If you do not know what type of Server 
you have you can check your Server Type and Operating System on the BPS System Info page. You can install BulletProof Security if you have a Windows IIS
hosted website to use the additional features in BPS, but may or may not be able to Activate BulletProof Modes depending on what your IIS Server does and 
does not have installed / configured. Please see this WordPress Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Permalinks#Permalinks_without_mod_rewrite" title="Permalinks without mod_rewrite" target="_blank">Permalinks without mod_rewrite</a> for additional information regarding IIS Servers and also the Helicon Tech website <a href="http://www.isapirewrite.com/" title="Helicon Tech ISAPI_Rewrite" target="_blank"> for additional information regarding ISAPI_Rewrite.

= Does BulletProof Security Work on ALL Nginx Servers / Server Configurations? =

If you are using both Apache and Nginx together and Nginx is the frontend webserver and Apache is the backend Server
used to process PHP then BulletProof Security will work on this type of combined Server Configuration. If you are only
using Nginx then an .htaccess file will not work. Nginx has its own rewrite module - HttpRewriteModule and the mod_rewrite equivalent
of an .htaccess file has similar, but different coding and is added to an Nginx Server config file.
Note: If you are not familiar with Nginx, then it should be noted that Nginx does not have a PHP module like Apache's mod_php, 
instead you either need to build PHP with FPM (ie: php-fpm/fastcgi), or you need to pass the request to something that can handle PHP.

= Are there any known issues or conflicts with other WordPress Plugins or Themes? =

Occasionally issues or conflicts do occur with other plugins, but they are always quickly resolved. BPS is compatible with all
other Plugins and Themes. An .htaccess bypass / skip rule is all that is required to allow a plugin or theme to do something that is blocked by BPS.
Please check the BulletProof Security <a href="http://www.ait-pro.com/aitpro-blog/2252/bulletproof-security-plugin-support/checking-plugin-compatibility-with-bps-plugin-testing-to-do-list/" title="BPS Plugin Testing and Fixes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Plugin Compatibility Testing and Fixes</a> page for the latest plugin bypass / skip rules. All new plugin skip / bypass 
rules are now being posted in the <a href="http://forum.ait-pro.com/" title="BPS Forum" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BulletProof Security Forum</a>.

= I am seeing Security Log entries in my BulletProof Security Log. What do they mean? =

Your Security Log will log 400, 403 and 404 (requires copying the BPS 404 logging code to your Theme's 404.php Template) Errors. 
The Security Log logs 400 and 403 HTTP Response Status Codes by default. You can also log 404 HTTP Response Status Codes by opening this BPS 
404 Template file - /bulletproof-security/404.php and copying the logging code into your Theme's 404 Template file. When you open the BPS Pro 
404.php file you will see simple instructions on how to add the 404 logging code to your Theme's 404 Template file.

= HTTP Response Status Codes =

* 400 Bad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax.
* 403 Forbidden - The Server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.
* 404 Not Found - The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI / URL. No indication is given to whether the condition is temporary or permanent.

= What is the difference between BulletProof Security free and BulletProof Security Pro? =

= Is BulletProof Security Network / Multisite Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security contains AutoMagic buttons for Network / Multisite websites. Both sub-directory and sub-domain Master .htaccess 
code is written / created for your specific Network / Multisite site based on your WordPress version. The BulletProof Security plugin can 
be Network Activated or you can allow BulletProof Security to be activated individually on each Network / Multisite subsite or of course 
you can choose not to Network Activate BulletProof Security or allow the BPS plugin on subsites. Only Login Security, System Info & Maintenance 
Mode menus are available on subsites. Super Admins will see BPS Dashboard Alerts and other Status displays on the Primary Site only. Administrators 
can activate or deactivate BulletProof Security on subsites if you allow this on your Network / Multisite website. The BPS Primary Site 
Menus will display all BPS menus. All other BulletProof Security features are not available on subsites since Network/Multisite subsites 
are virtual and do not have separate website files of their own. All of the other standard BulletProof Security features work sitewide and 
affect all other virtual subsites with the exception of Login Security which works individually for each specific website - Primary or 
virtual subsites and therefore should only be available to and controlled by the Super Admin with Network Admin capabilities for the 
Network/Multisite website. BulletProof Security also works with Network / Multisite Domain Mapping.

= Is BulletProof Security BuddyPress/bbPress Compatible? =

Yes. BulletProof Security works with all BuddyPress/bbPress site types.

= Is BulletProof Security Compatible with subdomain websites and subdirectory websites? =

Yes, BulletProof Security works on all types of WordPress installations including "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory" websites.
Note: Maintenance Mode may not work correctly on Network/Multisite Subdomain site types. Pending additional testing.

= Is BulletProof Security automatically setup already? =

Yes and No. You must be using a WordPress Custom Permalink structure for BPS to work correctly (every WordPress site should be anyway). If 
you are not using a custom Permalink structure then you will get a warning message that Custom Permalinks need to be enabled when you access 
the BulletProof Security Options page. BulletProof Security includes AutoMagic Master .htaccess file creation so that only one click is 
required to automatically create your Master .htaccess security files for your website, which you then Activate - BulletProof Mode. 
BulletProof Security also offers full manual control of editing the .htaccess files using the built-in File Editor. BulletProof Security is 
designed with everyone in mind: regular folks, Designers, Developers and Coders. BulletProof Security is designed to work with every type 
of WordPress installation: Single websites, subfolder websites, subdomain websites, "Giving WordPress its Own Directory" websites, 
Network / Multisite subdirectory websites and Network / Multisite subdomain websites. BulletProof Security will automatically create the correct Master 
.htaccess files for your website when you click the AutoMagic buttons. If you prefer to do everything manually then you would edit your 
.htaccess using the built-in .htaccess File Editor instead of using Automagic to automatically create your .htaccess files.

= Can I add my own .htaccess code to the BulletProof Security .htaccess files? =

Yes. Of course. The secure.htaccess and wpadmin-secure.htaccess Master .htaccess files already contain .htaccess security code that protects 
your website against XSS, RFI, CRLF, CSRF, Base64, Code Injection and SQL Injection hacking attempts. Add any additional security filters or 
other .htaccess code to your Master .htaccess files or your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. The 
BulletProof Security Master .htaccess files contain help info and additional options within the .htaccess files themselves. htaccess files 
can do a lot of neat things besides just providing website security protection. As of version .46.9 you can now also add any custom code 
to the Custom Code feature. Your custom .htaccess code will be saved to your WP DB permanently until you delete it. Please view the Read Me 
Help button in Custom Code for specific details.

= Does the BulletProof Security Plugin create or write the .htaccess files? =

Yes, BulletProof Security creates customized .htaccess website security files with AutoMagic. BulletProof Security also offers full manual 
control of editing both the BPS Master .htaccess files and your currently active .htaccess files using the built-in .htaccess File Editor. 
The BPS Master .htaccess files have already been pre-made. When you click the AutoMagic buttons your .htaccess Master files are created with 
specific code for your specific website with the correct RewriteRule and RewriteBase automatically added to your .htaccess files. You can 
add additional code to the master .htaccess files, edit the .htaccess files or create completely new .htaccess master files from within the 
WordPress Dashboard using the built-in BPS File Editor - no FTP required - no Web Host Control Panel required. BPS could also just be used 
simply as an online .htaccess file editor and manager. AutoMagic is great, but having both AutoMagic and full manual editing control makes 
BulletProof Security a very versatile website security protection tool.

* Enjoy!

= .49.9 =
* New Feature: Maintenance Mode - FrontEnd/BackEnd Maintenance Mode
Maintenance Mode Guide
The previous Maintenance Mode feature in BPS has been completely removed/replaced with the new Maintenance Mode feature in BPS .49.9. This is a completely new BPS feature. The new BPS Maintenance Mode design includes 20 background images, 15 center images (text box image), allows you to embed image files and YouTube videos, FrontEnd Maintenance Mode, BackEnd Maintenance Mode or both FrontEnd & BackEnd Maintenance Modes and most importantly is fast and simple to use so that you can switch in and out of Maintenance mode quickly and easily. Background image files/options and Center images (text box image) are independent of each other so that you can mix and match different background images with different Center images (text box image).
* New Headers check tool added to the System Info page:
Check your website Headers or another website's Headers by making a GET Request. Both GET and HEAD Headers checking is now available on the System Info page.

* BPS Plugin/Theme Script Dequeue function added: Dequeue any/all other plugin or theme scripts that attempt to load in BPS plugin pages:
A new BPS function has been added that Dequeues any/all other plugin or theme scripts on/in BPS plugin pages ONLY, which causes a wide variety of problems for BPS , such as broken plugin functionality, broken menus and pages not displaying visually correct. This new BPS Dequeue function only runs on/in BPS plugin pages and does not run anywhere else or affect anything else on a website. The BPS Dequeue function is only designed to prevent any other plugins or themes from loading their scripts in BPS plugin pages and does not do or affect anything else on a website.
* Security Log Code Correction/Enhancement: Security Log User Agent/Bot filter auto-updated during BPS upgrade:
The BPS 403.php Security Log template file is replaced during BPS plugin updates/upgrades, which is normal WordPress plugin update/upgrade procedure.

The BPS 403.php Security Logging template is now auto-updated during BPS plugin upgrades/updates and automatically adds any previously added/saved User Agent/Bot filters to the new 403.php template file if any User Agents/Bots to Ignore/Not Log were previously added/saved.
