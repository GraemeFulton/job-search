<strong>Capabilities</strong>

* In v1.0+, you can limit Dashboard access to Admins or by selecting a capability. More information on WordPress' default roles and capabilities can be found here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities

<strong>User Profile Access</strong>

* In v1.0+, you can allow or disallow the ability for all users to edit their profiles in the Dashboard. Users lacking the chosen capability won't be able to access any other sections of the Dashboard.

<strong>Hiding other plugins/themes' Toolbar menus</strong>

v1.0+ hides some built-in WordPress Toolbar menus by default, but can be extended to hide menus from other plugins or themes via two filters: `rda_toolbar_nodes`, and `rda_frontend_toolbar_nodes`.

How to find the menu (node) id:

* In the HTML page source, look for the `<li>` container for the menu node you're targeting. It should take the form of `<li id="wp-admin-bar-SOMETHING">`
* In `<li id="wp-admin-bar-SOMETHING">`, you want the "SOMETHING" part.
	
How to filter the disallowed Toolbar nodes on the front-end:
`
function hide_some_toolbar_menu( $ids ) {
	$ids[] = 'SOMETHING';
	return $ids;
}
add_filter( 'rda_frontend_toolbar_nodes', 'hide_some_toolbar_menu' );
`

Common plugin Toolbar menus and their ids:

* <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">JetPack by WordPress.com</a> (Notifications) - 'notes'
* <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO by Yoast</a> - 'wpseo-menu'
* <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/">W3 Total Cache</a> - 'w3tc'
