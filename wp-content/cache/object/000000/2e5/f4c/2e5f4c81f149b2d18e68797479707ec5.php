With a maximum of 6 students, we offer a unique 30 day course on a private 200 hectare farm in the heart of the Tsitsikamma Forest. Our location is a haven for plant, bird and animal life.

We cover all the basics of Pre-Production, Production and Post Production with the latest technology (3D) in a fun, beautiful and peaceful environment.
