#Lostgrad Job Search Website

Lostgrad.com was created to help students discover opportunities from 4 categories: courses, work experience, graduate jobs, and travel. It was essentially a community site.
After running the site for about a year, it was evident from the Google Analytics, and Twitter interactions with users that people were only interested in one part of the entire site - the job section. 
Hardly anybody looked at any of the pages apart from the Graduate jobs section - so nobody actually wanted all the courses or travel posts. Other than that, the site only had about 80 people register.

This is a new redesigned version of this site to focuse on jobs only.
