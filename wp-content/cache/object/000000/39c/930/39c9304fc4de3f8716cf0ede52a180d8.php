Welcome your new life down under! If you want great value, lots of inclusions and wicked laughs on your arrival in Australia, then look no further. Seamlessly combining all you need in terms of job assistance, accommodation and great group activities in your first few days or week, we guarantee you can absolutely love Australia. Our packages are designed to be lots of fun and exceptional value but because everyone has different needs we have different options depending upon how much assistance you want…
<h2>What work in Australia packages do we have?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The premium package is the <a href="http://www.xtremegapyear.co.uk/trip/sydney-connexion/" target="_blank">Sydney conneXion</a> which is so much more than just work and accommodation assistance.</li>
	<li>Then we have the 5 night gold package which is very comprehensive without some of the more fun ( but pricier) options of the Sydney ConneXion.</li>
	<li>The silver package is perfect if you’re on a budget and costs only £209</li>
</ul>
