Working in Australia on a real Australian Ranch in the outbackâ€¦ That is something different! In just 5 days we will train you up to work on a ranch in the Australian Outback! It is pretty hard work on a ranch, but great fun and at the end of it, depending on which package you choose, you have the choice of starting a job (paying up to AU$600 a week) going off travelling with new skills under your belt. If you do choose our gold or silver package, your job search is made easy as we will find your job for you! Either way, youâ€™ll be equipped with the skills you need to earn some money doing a fun, adventurous job. It certainly beats mundane fruit picking. The ranch guarantees the job offer(s) if you pass the course however please note the type of job you are offered and the subsequent salary is at the discretion of course leaders as they can only place you in a job if you have the skills to match. The percentage of people getting a job offered is approximately 90%. There are about 30 to 70 jobs available each week. So if you show you are up for it, we can get you a job in a truly Australian setting!
