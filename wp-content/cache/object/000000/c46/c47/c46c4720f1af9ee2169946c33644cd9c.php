Venezuela has epic proportions, it has South Americas largest lake and third longest river, the highest waterfall in the world and the longest of all snakes. It has Jaguars, armadillos and some of the most spectacular landscapes on earth. There are the snow capped peaks of the Andesin the west, steamy jungles in the South, the hauntingly beautiful Gran Sabana plateau, with eerie flat topped mountains, in the east, and miles and miles of white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms on the Caribbean coast. There can be no better country to offer adventure and exploration. This is exactly what our adventure classroom offers, all the while you will be learning to speak Spanish and developing personally through countless interactions with another world. Our award winning travelling classroom programme is a unique blend of learning Spanish and travelling adventure. Based in a beautiful country of huge diversity with golden palm fringed beaches, exotic jungles, spectacular and mysterious mountains, ancient indigenous cultures and the beat of exotic Latino! Based at our Caribbean Lodge on one of VenezuelaÂ´s best beaches, Playa Colorada (the coloured beach!), in Mochima National Park, you take adventure travel expeditions while learning Spanish.
