But what lies in the half of our world covered by water more than two miles deep? How are our everyday lives connected to the ocean depths, and what challenges and opportunities does this previously hidden realm hold for our future? In this course you will join scientists exploring the ocean from the deepest undersea vents to the chilly waters of the Poles, going deeper, longer, and more often than ever before - and find how what we now know about the ocean depths is as amazing as the unknown that remains. By taking this course, you will see how the deep ocean is no longer out of reach, and join a global debate about the future of our ‚Äúblue planet‚Äù.</p>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: University of Southampton | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: Jon Copley  &amp; Verity Nye</p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Exploring our oceans";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:108:"Explore the half of our world covered by deep ocean, and how our lives affect the hidden face of our planet.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"exploring-our-oceans-2014-02-12";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:23";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:23";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"course";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
