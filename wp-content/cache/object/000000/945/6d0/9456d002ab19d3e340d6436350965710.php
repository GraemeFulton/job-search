The century also saw the abandonment of many villages through general population decline, and a shift towards greater use of the land for pasture farming. But demand for labour meant that the prosperity of working people rose, and towards the end of the century, the introduction of printing transformed access to literacy and books. </p>                  <p>Each week we will address a different perspective: medieval warfare, the lives of peasants and farmers, food and culture, death and commemoration, reading and the introduction of printing. Finally, we will look at how historians and archaeologists have reconstructed Richard’s road to Bosworth and how one of England’s most famous Kings came to be buried in Leicester.</p>                  <p><strong>Please note, the beta run of this course is in October, but due to its popularity we are now taking sign-ups for a second run in early 2014.</strong></p>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: University of Leicester | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: Deirdre O&#39;Sullivan</p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:39:"England in the time of King Richard III";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:127:"Explore 15th century England through archaeology, history and literature against the backdrop of the excavation of Richard III.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:50:"england-in-the-time-of-king-richard-iii-2014-02-12";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:50";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:50";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"course";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
