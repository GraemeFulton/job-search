During theÂ Galapagos Islands ExperienceÂ you have two options to explore the stunning islands, made famous by Charles Darwin who developed the theory of natural selection, while studying the unique wildlife there.
You can choose to go island hopping by boat (over four days), or you can join an overland tour that island hops, perfect if you do not have sea legs. This can be booked as a standalone trip if you are short on time, but if you are not, then you can add on two extra weeks on a conservation project, to really get to know the islands. Lets face it if you are going all that way, you would be nuts not to.

The Galapagos, is one of the worlds most unique locations for wildlife, but it is pretty remote. Over 1000 kilometres off the pacific coastline of Ecuador, you will need to fly into the airstrip located in the Galapagos, and for this reason we include flights from Quito with this trip. This does push the price up somewhat, however this experience is totally unique, and in our opinion the Galapagos is one of the locations you have to visit in your lifetime. What better time to do it than if travelling to Ecuador. Obviously the big draw for the Galapagos Islands is the animals, but be warned on the Galapagos the animals completely lack fear! This gives you a chance to easily swim next to sea lions, penguins and other marine life. Also it is a paradise for snorkelling; you can see manta rays, turtles, sharks and more.
