With the decline of local professional media and the low cost of publishing online there are more community and hyper-local sites being launched to take the place of local newspapers and radio.  For both those seeking to launch and support a site and for those wishing to study this new media sector there are practical skills and theory to be mastered.  It is an area which combines elements of traditional journalism with the new skills of digital journalism and community focus. </p>                  <p>Cardiff University launched the UKâ€™s first academic Centre for Community Journalism last year to help nurture and study this growing sector. Over five weeks, this course builds on that expertise and experience to offer insight and practical skills for all those interested in community and hyper local journalism. The course combines practical skills in setting up a community website, identifying and building an audience, creating content, establishing a workflow to sustain a site, managing an online community, media law and ethics, with a broader understanding of this new sector, how it has developed and the experience of those operating community sites.  It will also explore different forms of community â€“ whether geographic, professional or personal interest.</p>       <div class="additional_content"><p>University: Cardiff University | Subject: N/A | Provider: Future Learn | Instructor: Richard Sambrook</p></div>";s:10:"post_title";s:20:"Community Journalism";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:103:"Gain practical skills and insight into hyper-local journalism, learning how to create your own service.";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:31:"community-journalism-2014-02-12";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:44";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2014-02-12 19:48:44";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:0:"";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:6:"course";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
